Stylesheet: Main Stylesheet

Here's where the magic happens. Here, you'll see we are calling in
the separate media queries. The base mobile goes outside any query
and is called at the beginning, after that we call the rest
of the styles inside media queries.
******************************************************************/


//
// IMPORTING STYLES
//

// import normalize
@import "_normalize.less";

// import mixins
@import "_mixins.less";

/*
BASE (MOBILE) SIZE
This are the mobile styles. It's what people see on their phones. If
you set a great foundation, you won't need to add too many styles in
the other stylesheets. Remember, keep it light: Speed is Important.
*/

@import "_flexslider.less";

// styles in base.less
@import "_base.less";

/*
TABLET & SMALLER LAPTOPS
This is the average viewing window. So Desktops, Laptops, and
in general anyone not viewing on a mobile device. Here's where
you can add resource intensive styles.
*/
@media (min-device-width: 1024px) {

	// import grid
	@import "_grid.less";
    @import "_width_1024px.less";


} // end of media query


/*
PRINT STYLESHEET
Feel free to customize this. Remember to add things that won't make
sense to print at the bottom. Things like nav, ads, and forms should
be set to display none.
*/
@media print {
	
	@import "_print.less";
	
} // end of media query
